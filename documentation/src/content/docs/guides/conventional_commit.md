title: Conventional Commits
---

To maintain a clean and readable commit history, **we enforce the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard**.

## What is a Conventional Commit?

A conventional commit follows this structure:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples

- `feat(auth): add support for OAuth2 login`
- `fix(api): handle 500 errors from backend`
- `docs(readme): update setup instructions`
- `refactor(ui): simplify button component`

---

## PR Titles

Your **pull request title must also follow the Conventional Commit format**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the PR title does not follow this convention, **GitHub Actions will fail**, and the PR will be blocked from merging.
