title: Getting started
---

Bauhaus is a single page application built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/reduxreact). It was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and designed thanks to [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). To run the application in development mode, run the following commands from a shell prompt in the local directory, and then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```shell
# Download all the dependencies needed by the application
yarn install
# Compiles the code and starts a minimal web server
yarn start
```

We discovered an error when using the command `yarn start` with a path containing accentuated characters. If this is also the case for you, you can also usr the command `npm start` instead of `yarn start`.

Application needs externals Web services : Bauhaus-Back-Office(https://github.com/InseeFr/Bauhaus-Back-Office).

## Test

`yarn test` runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
An other script, `yarn test:coverage` allows to generate a complete local report `Bauhaus/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

Some Integrations tests are also available thanks to _Cypress.io_. You should use the `yarn cypress:open` command if you want to launch these tests on dev mode. For your CI, you have to use the `yarn cypress:run` command.

Unit tests are launched each time a `git push` is executed.

## Build

To build the application, run `yarn build`. You can now serve the content of the `dist` folder with the HTTP server of your choice. 

For the deployment needs at INSEE, the CI will need to use the yarn build-insee command. This command will also create an archive (zip) containing the project in order to deploy it.

### Docker

You can also build a Docker container :

```shell
docker build . -t bauhaus-front
````

And run it :

```shell
docker run  -it -p 8083:80 -e BAUHAUS_API_URL=http://192.168.1.12:8081/api bauhaus-front
```

`http://192.168.1.12:8081/api` is the base URL of the Bauhaus API.

## New to JavaScript and Node.js

If you're new to JavaScript, you might need to first install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) on your computer.

`yarn` is the `Node.js` package manager. `yarn install` will download all the dependencies needed by the project, as described in the `dependencies` and `devDepedencies` sections of the [package.json](https://github.com/InseeFr/Bauhaus/blob/main/package.json) file.

`yarn start` will launch the `dev` command defined in the `scripts` section of the same `package.json` file. This command will launch a local web server serving the main HTML file ([src/js/index.html](https://github.com/InseeFr/Bauhaus/blob/main/public/index.html)) and all the relevant assets.

`yarn build` will launch the compilation with some optimizations for production. It copies all the static assets and the resulting bundle file in the `dist` folder.

## Project Structure

In this paragraph, we will try to explain the rules we defined and try to follow when talking about the structure of the project.

### SCSS Mixin

If you have to define SCSS mixin, you have to define them in the `src/styles/mixin.scss` file, and import them in the stylesheet of the React component.

### I18N

In order to avoid big i18n file, we try to split this file in smaller files, based on `page` or `feature`. For example, we have a `src/js/i18n/dictionary/operations/documents.js` file for all messages dedicated to the documents feature.
This files have to be imported directly or not in the main file `js/i18n/dictionary/app.js`.
